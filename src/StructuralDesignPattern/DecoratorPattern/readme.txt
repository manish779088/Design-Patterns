Adherence to the Open/Closed Principle:
The decorator pattern adheres to the Open/Closed Principle,
which states that software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.
By using decorators, we can introduce new features without modifying the original classes or interfaces.


Decorator is a structural design pattern that lets you attach new behaviors to objects by placing
these objects inside special wrapper objects that contain the behaviors.
