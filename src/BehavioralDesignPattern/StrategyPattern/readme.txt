In Strategy Pattern we solve problem ->
When we have multiple child of parent class and child need to override functionality of
parent class then w\
if more than one child overiding method and overide method have same codes for multiple child then this is
code duplicacy.


The objectives of the strategy pattern are:
Define a common interface for multiple algorithms or behaviours.
Encapsulate each algorithm or behaviour in a separate class.
Allow the client code to select the desired algorithm or behaviour at runtime.
