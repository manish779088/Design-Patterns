The Chain of Responsibility pattern allows a request sent by a client to be received
by more than one object. It creates a chain of loosely-coupled objects that,
upon receiving the request, either handle it or pass it to the next handler object.

A common example of this pattern is event bubbling in DOM. An event propagates through
different nested elements of the DOM until one of them handles it.
