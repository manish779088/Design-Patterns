S- Single Responsibility Principle
O- Open/closed principle
L- Liskov substitution principle
I - Interface Segment Principle
D - Dependency Principle

S - A class should have single responsibility.  A class should have only 1 reason to change.
O-  Open for extension but close for modification
L-  Used to inheritance properly, child class should not break the behaviour/method of parent class.
I - Interfacse should be such that , that client should not implement unnecessary functions they do need
    make smaller pieces of interface.
D -Class should depend on interfaces rather than concrete classes.

Helps us to write better code-
-Avoid Duplicate code
-Easy to maintain
-Easy to understand
-Flexible software
-Reduce Complexity
